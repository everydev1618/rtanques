#Rtanque challenge

Tonight's challenge will be to design a
[Rtanque](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque) which will compete against
opposing teams at the end of the night.

##Setup locally

1. Make sure you have 2.0.X Ruby on your machine, if you don't, start installing it now
2. The instructions for getting started [here are
   great](http://awilliams.github.io/articles/rtanque-getting-started/) and you should follow them
3. Run a test run once you have the repo cloned (`bundle exec rtanque start
   --width=400 --height=400 sample_bots/camper:x4`)
4. Start building your Tanque!

OSX: If it is displayed funny when you run a test run, you probably need to
install the libraries that Gosu depends on. With homebrew this can be done with
`brew install sdl2 libogg libvorbis`.

Other display issues, try here:
